# tulip
A 2-D game engine based upon SDL2. This attempt will try to incorporate the composition approach and may still use inheritance if and when it makes sense.

# Patch notes v0p0

## New features
  1. Added all files for compilation of SDL2.

  2. Added makefile and ensured compilation.

  3. Added git ignore file (.gitignore) to avoid commiting object files to the repository.

## Thoughts and TODOs
  * The make file is really written only for facilitating unit tests and not releases.

  * The code in the compilation unit_test.cpp is taken verbatim from the [first lazyfoo SDL2 tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php).
